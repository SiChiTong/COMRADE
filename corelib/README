Project COMRADE corelib
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This library contains lots of routines that are common to the robot
and the monitoring node GUI.

Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	* libsigc++ >= 2.0 (http://libsigc.sf.net/)
	* libglibmm >= 2.4 (http://gtkmm.sf.net/)
	* log4cpp   >= 0.3 (http://log4cpp.sf.net/)

Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make install

This should install the library and the header files. To generate the
documentation, go to the docs/ directory and run doxygen from there.
The generated docs will be in docs/html/. (This should be automated,
but.. bleh)
