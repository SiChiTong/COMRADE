	* Singleton class template didn't work properly, fixed now.
	* Added a centralized logger component for debug and error messages.
	* Added a class called CorelibObject which is the object which should
	  be created first in the application - it creates lots of other needed
	  objects in the right order.

	* The XML can now contain more than one subnode with the same name,

	* You can use operator[] to read subnodes, for example:
	  	maintree["config"]["robot"]["name"].get_text()
