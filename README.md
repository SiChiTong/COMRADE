CoOperative Mobile Robots for Autonomous Decisive Exploration
This is the complete source code from my college project. It includes:

1) Microcontroller interfacing code
2) Webcam interfacing code (uusing libfg)
3) Control routines for building up environment maps from sonar.
4) Machine vision library. IRIS is embedded.
